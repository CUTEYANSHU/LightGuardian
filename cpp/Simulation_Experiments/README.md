## File Description
- `topology`:  Generate json config file for mininet simulation with specific topology.
- `sketch`:  A `C++` based sketch algorithm benchmark, loading datasets generated by mininet or direct simulation, and test the accuracy of sketches on these traces.
- `analysis`: Several helper functions to analyze log files generated by mininet.
- `sim`: Direct simulation in Python without mininet.

## Usages
There are four main usages.

1. Generate topology for mininet simulation.
    - In `topology` folder, modify `parameter.py` to change some parameters.
    - Type `python3 fattree.py > $(output_file)` to generate json config file for mininet, where `$(output_file)` is the name of output file.
2. Convert mininet log files into traces for sketch benchmark.
    - In `analysis` folder, modify `parameter.py` to change some parameters.
    - Modify `swlog_hanlder.py` and use `handle_swlog()` and `create_meta()` methods.
    - Run `python3 swlog_handler.py` to generate traces for sketch benchmark.
3. Perform simulations in C++ directly and generate traces.
    - In `sim` folder, modify parameters in `tracegen.py`.
    - Run `python3 tracegen.py` to generate traces for sketch benchmark.
4. Test the accuracy of sketches on traces.
    - In `sketch` folder, type `make` to build.
    - Change parameters of sketches and type of the test in `main()` funciton.
    - Run it by `./benchmark`.
